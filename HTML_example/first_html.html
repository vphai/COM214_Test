        <h3>Alicia Keys' New Song </h3>
        <p>Alicia Keys has unveiled new song "That's What's Up" along with
            an accompanying video on her birthday on Wednesday. The inspirational
            tune samples Kanye West's "Low Lights," which hails from The Life of
            Pablo. The singer posted the clip on Facebook, where she revealed the
            video was a birthday song and wrote, "I'm so thankful!" The low-key
            footage is shot home movie-style and follows the singer as she's
            lounging in a bathrobe and later singing in a bathtub.

        <h3>Tech scrambles after Trump issues immigration order</h3>
        <p>President Donald Trumpâ€™s broad executive order to restrict visas and
            refugees particularly from Muslim countries left tech giants like Apple,
            Facebook, Google and Microsoft scrambling on Saturday to safeguard their
            employees and register their opposition with the White House. A day after
            Trump signed the controversial directive, Apple CEO Tim Cook told
            employees in an email obtained by POLITICO that he had heard their
            concerns, adding: "It is not a policy we support."
